# Edison

Edison is a RISCV code IDE for simulating and debugging RISCV code. Its written in typescript and uses react for UI. It is made for educational purposes and is not intended to be used in production. It is not fully compliant with RISC-V specification, but it can run some simple programs. Also emulates pipelined CPU with 4 stages: fetch, decode, execute, writeback.

Its powered by Vega engine, which is a RISC-V emulator written in typescript for RCV32I instruction set. You can find more information about Vega engine down below.

## Code editor features

- [x] Syntax highlighting
- [x] Code completion
- [x] Code formatting
- [x] Code folding
- [x] Code snippets
- [x] Code linting
- [x] Code debugging
- [x] Code breakpoints

## Simulation view features

- [x] General purpose registers view
- [x] Instruction Memory view
- [x] Data Memory view
- [x] Pipeline view
- [x] Disassembly view
- [x] Datapath simulation view

## Usage

To run the IDE you need to have nodejs installed on your machine. You can install it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

To start using edison you can simply clone this repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone
cd edison
npm install
```

Then you can start the IDE:

```bash
npm run dev
```

or if you are using yarn:

```bash
yarn dev
```
# Vega Engine

Vega engine is a RISC-V emulator written in typescript for RCV32I instruction set. Its made for educational purposes and is not intended to be used in production. It is not fully compliant with RISC-V specification, but it can run some simple programs. Also emulates pipelined CPU with 4 stages: fetch, decode, execute, writeback.

## Features

- [x] RCV32I instruction set
- [x] 4 stage pipelined CPU
- [x] 32 registers
- [x] 4KB memory

## Currently supported instructions

We have support only for this instructions. If you want to contribute adding new instructions it will be a great support.

- [x] srl x0, x0, x1
- [x] sll x0, x0, x1
- [x] lw x0, 0(x1)
- [x] sw x0, 0(x1)
- [x] ld x0, 0(x1)
- [x] sd x0, 0(x1)
- [x] beq x0, x1, x1
- [x] add x0, x0, x1
- [x] sub x0, x0, x1
- [x] and x0, x0, x1
- [x] or x0, x0, x1
- [x] xorx0, x0, x1

## Usage

To run the emulator you need to have nodejs installed on your machine. You can install it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).
To add vega engine to your project you need to install it from npm:

```bash
npm install @riscv/vega
```

Then you can import it in your project:

```javascript
import { Vega } from "@riscv/vega";
```

To run the emulator you need to create an instance of Vega class use the run method passing the path to the binary file as an argument:

```javascript
const vega = new Vega();
vega.run("path/to/binary/file");
```
